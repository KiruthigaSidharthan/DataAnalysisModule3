-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.
select product_id , name , price from products where price > ( select avg( price) from products );

-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
select max(price) from products where category_id =
 (select category_id from categories where name like 'beans');

-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.
select customer_id,first_name,last_name from customers where customer_id in
(select customer_id from orders where order_id in
(select order_id from order_items where product_id in
(select product_id from products where category_id in
(select category_id from categories where name like 'Merch'))));

-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.
select product_id , name , price from products where product_id not in 
(select order_id from orders);

-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.
select product_id,name,total_units_sold from (
select p.product_id,p.name,sum(oi.quantity) as total_units_sold from products p
join order_items oi on p.product_id = oi.product_id group by p.product_id, p.name) dt
where total_units_sold > (select avg(total_units_sold)from (select sum(quantity) as total_units_sold from order_items
group by product_id) avg_dt);
